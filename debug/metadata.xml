    <description>A really useful debugging tool I created a while ago.
All the following features can be activated/deactivated from the in-game console. Just enable this mod when you want to debug, and disable it when you want to play.

Here's what it does:

- spawns all modded items at the beginning of a new run.
- debugs basic game stuff (curses, last damage source and flag, current room id...)

- debugs type.variant.subtype of every entity.
- debugs spawner of every entity.

- debugs health and npcState of enemies.

- shows a list of all sounds played in a room.

Here's a lit of the commands:
 - &quot;moddebug help&quot;: shows a list of all the commands
 - &quot;moddebug spawnitems&quot;: Toggles modded items spawning on/off
 - &quot;moddebug spawntrinkets&quot;: Toggles modded trinket spawning on/off
 - &quot;moddebug gameinfo&quot;: Toggles game info debugging on/off
 - &quot;moddebug sfx&quot;: Toggles sfx debugging on/off
 - &quot;moddebug enemies&quot;: Toggles enemy debugging on/off
 - &quot;moddebug pickups&quot;: Toggles pickup debugging on/off
 - &quot;moddebug items&quot;: Toggles item debugging on/off
 - &quot;moddebug all&quot;: Toggles all entities debugging on/off</description>
